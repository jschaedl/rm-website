about-us.text: "RemedyMatch was part of the German government's WirVsVirus hackathon between the 20th and 22nd of March. From over 1200 projects RemedyMatch was selected as one of 20 winning teams. Just three days later, the platform alpha went live. Since then, an interdisciplinary expert team of over 60 people has come together working on a voluntary basis to develop a scalable open source donation and logistics platform. RemedyMatch pursues the goal of bringing together inventory and demand for medical protective and emergency relief  items quickly, easily and locally, thereby helping to bridge supply bottlenecks during the Covid 19 crisis and beyond.\n"
